# 02_03 Create a Pull Request

## Pull Requests

Pull requests create a special checkpoint in the software development process.

- Abbreviated as “PR”
- A request to merge changes from one branch into another
- Changes may include new features or bug fixes

Pull requests provide a framework for:

- Collaboration
- Reviewing changes
- Providing feedback
- Supporting code quality

## Pull Request Workflow

1. Branch - Create a branch and add changes
1. Pull Request - Create a pull request with a title and description that add context to the changes
1. Review - Discuss changes and provide feedback
1. Approve - Accept changes
1. Merge - Update the `main` branch
