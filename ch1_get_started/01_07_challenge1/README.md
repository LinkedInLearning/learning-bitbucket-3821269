# 01_06 Challenge: Create a Repo and Push Code

## Challenge Scenario

Let’s use a challenge to apply what you’ve learned about Bitbucket.

You’re part of a software development team working on a new, AMAZING, open-source application.  The team is inviting the community to work with them and they need a cloud-based repository service to store the code.

The team is asking you to configure Bitbucket so the community can add files to the application.  However, they also need to work with some files separately and discretely, away from the application’s code base.

## Challenge Tasks

1. Log into Bitbucket and create a new workspace.
1. In the new workspace, create a project named **`amazing`**
1. Inside the project, create two repositories.
1. The first repo should be named **`community`**.  This repo should be visible to anyone with the URL.
1. The second repo should be named **`team`** and should only be visible by members of the team.
1. Clone both repos to your local system and add a markdown file named **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** to each repo.
1. Push the files back to Bitbucket with the commit message **`repo is ready`**.
1. Confirm that both repos have been created per the team's requirements.

This challenge should take about 15 minutes to complete.
