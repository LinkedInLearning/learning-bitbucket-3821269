# 00_01 Introduction
Modern software development requires tools that track code changes, encourage collaboration, and help us manage multiple projects all at the same time.

[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) is a cloud-based solution that handles all of these tasks and much more.

Hi, I’m Michael Jenkins. I’m a seasoned computer engineer and I’ve been using Bitbucket for years.

I’m thrilled to be your instructor for this course and I’m excited to share some of the ways Bitbucket can be an asset for your software development needs.

By the end of this course, you'll have the knowledge and skills you need to use Bitbucket for hosting git-based repositories,
collaborating with branches and pull requests,
and managing project workflows with Jira.

Are you ready? I hope so.

Let’s jump in and start Learning Bitbucket.
